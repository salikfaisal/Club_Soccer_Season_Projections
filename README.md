# Club_Soccer_Season_Projections
This project outputs the summary of 10,000 Simulated League Seasons in 5 Domestic Leagues across Europe. . <br>
Each league's summary includes estimated points, goal difference, title chances, chances of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League, relegation. <br>
League Simulations are calculated using a combination of league results and simulated matches based on [elo ratings](http://clubelo.com/) assigned to each team. <br>
I will try to update weekly, but may update more frequently at certain times.

The simulation includes results for:

- UEFA Champions League [(Group Stage)](https://github.com/salikfaisal/Club_Soccer_Season_Projections/blob/main/UCL_Group_Stage_Expected_Results.csv)
